		<p>According to House, customised cartoons are "the most recent activity to push certain boundaries between fashion and other forms of entertainment, culture, and technology, and to break away from the category where brands can be easily defined."</p>
        <p>Certainly, the entire performance was very enjoyable, with guests lining up at the venue with colorful photo calls and everything broadcasting inside as if it were an Oscar.</p>

		<h2>Daniel Lee left Bottega Veneta</h2>
		<p>Less than a month after holding a enthusiastic show in Detroit, including Mary J. Blizzie, Lil Kim, and Kellani, Italian luxury brand Bottega Veneta announced that it would break up with creative director Daniel Lee.</p>
		<p>The news came hours before the American Fashion Designers Association, where British Lee was nominated for two categories: International Women's Clothes Designer of the Year and International Men's Clothes Designer of the Year, and two weeks before the Fashion Awards in London, where Lee was named Designer of the Year.</p>
		<p>In fact, Lee introduced a very clear identity for this brand.</p>
		<p>Built on some kind of rigorous modern engineering. </p>
	    <p>So the tangy, saturated shade of lime green became known as "Bottega Green" virtually overnight.</p>
